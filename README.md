# Workshop #2 - Creating Stylesheets with CSS
Last tutorial we used a stylesheet from a website. This week we will focus on making our own! If you are new or haven't completed the tutorial from last week, please refer to it here: https://github.com/drshika/gwc-html-workshop. You can also copy it and use it for this lesson!
## Creating new files
1. Go to Trinket and sign in as usual! Click on the plus sign to add a new file called styles.css

![CSS](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f46cbc20-e28e-4032-9780-97270c8861c0)

Create another file called recipes.html and copy this code in.
```
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Projects</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@exampledev/new.css@1.1.2/new.min.css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.xz.style/serve/inter.css">
</head>
<body>
<header>
    <h1>Recipes</h1>
        <nav>
            <a href="index.html">Home</a>
            <a href="projects.html">Projects</a>
            <a href="recipes.html">Recipes</a>
        </nav>
    </header>
</body>
```
