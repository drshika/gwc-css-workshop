# Workshop #2 - Creating Stylesheets with CSS
Last tutorial we used a stylesheet from a website. This week we will focus on making our own! If you are new or haven't completed the tutorial from last week, please refer to it here: https://github.com/drshika/gwc-html-workshop. You can also copy it and use it for this lesson!
## Creating a new file
